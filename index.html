    					<!-- This was where my header was previously-->
    					<p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family.  My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism.  As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there.  I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
    				</div>
    				<div class = "half-width">
    					<p>That curiousity then opened a door that could never be shut.  When I learned how to build my first website, I realised I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work.  Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organisation skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

    					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
    					<p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

    					<img src = "img/css-icon.png" alt = "CSS icon"/>
    					<h3>Well-Organised CSS</h3>
    					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.  I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

    					<p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
